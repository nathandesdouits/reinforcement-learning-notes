Notes and exercises for *Reinforcement Learning: an Introduction* by Sutton and Barto
=====================================================================================

As the name suggests, this depository is an ensemble of notes and exercises solutions for the great book by Sutton and Barto, *Reinforcement Learning: an Introduction*, which can be found [here](https://www.dropbox.com/s/7jl597kllvtm50r/book2015april.pdf?dl=1).
Both notes and exercises solutions for each chapter are presented in the IPython notebook format, in order to easily intertwin code and explanations.
You should read the book first before using these notes.

What these notebooks are
------------------------

* a collection of small, summarized core concepts and formulas that are treated in the book chapter
* a collection of hopefully correct solutions for each exercise, whenever possible
* a collection of sample code for the programming exercises

What these notebooks **aren't**
-------------------------------

* a copy of the book
* a reworded or light version of the book
* the official companion notes of the book
* an official correction of the exercises
* a super efficient library for reinforcement learning

Contributions
-------------

You are encouraged to participate in the writing of the notes and solutions. English is unfortunately not my mother tongue, so there should be lots of mistakes or weird phrasing. Feel free to correct me! I'll be glad to include your suggestions/corrections.
